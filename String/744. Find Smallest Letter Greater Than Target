You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.

Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.

class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        int start=0;
        int end=letters.size()-1;

        while(start<=end){
            int mid=(start+end)/2;

            if(letters[mid]>target){
                end=mid-1;
            }else{
                start=mid+1;
            }
        }
        return letters[start%letters.size()];
    }
};
